To "hydrate" these tweet IDs, I recommend using one of two [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/) tools: either [the command-line tool twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) or [the desktop application Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator). You can find more set-up information and documentation on those respective GitHub pages.

If you decide to hydrate these tweet IDs and use this data, please take steps to acknowledge users'
creative productions as well as protect users from potentially unwanted publicity or harm.
